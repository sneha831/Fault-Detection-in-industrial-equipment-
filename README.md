# Fault-Detection-in-industrial-equipment-
Built a machine learning model to predict machine failures using sensor data like temperature, RPM, torque, and tool wear. Trained and evaluated the model using scikit-learn and saved it for future use. Gained hands-on experience in predictive maintenance.
