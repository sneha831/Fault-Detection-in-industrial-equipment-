#  Fault Detection in Industrial Equipment Using Sensor Data

This project was developed as a mini group project focused on applying machine learning to detect faults in industrial equipment using sensor data. I led the team through the process of cleaning the data, building the model, and interpreting the results.

## Dataset
- **File used:** `predictive_maintenance.csv`
- Contains simulated sensor readings such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed (RPM), torque, and tool wear, along with machine failure labels.

##  Project Goal
Our objective was to predict potential machine failures using classification techniques, helping to support preventive maintenance decisions and reduce unexpected breakdowns in industrial settings.

##  My Role
As the **team leader**, I guided the workflow, divided tasks among teammates, handled the machine learning model training, and ensured that the final output was accurate and meaningful. I also focused on understanding the impact of each sensor reading on failure prediction.

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)  
- Joblib (for saving the trained model)

##  What We Did
1. Explored and cleaned the dataset  
2. Handled label encoding for categorical data  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Trained a classification model  
5. Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy and error rates  
6. Saved the model for future use

##  Outcome
The final model was able to predict machine failures effectively based on sensor input. This mini project helped us understand how ML can be applied to real industrial data, and how teamwork contributes to building smarter solutions.
